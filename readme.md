# Intellectual Property Management Database Design

## Execution Summary

This Markdown file outlines the design of a MongoDB document database for managing intellectual property (IP). It provides a structured approach for storing and retrieving various types of intellectual property assets efficiently.

## Project Requirements

1. **Store Information**: Store information about different types of intellectual property assets, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.
2. **Maintain Relationships**: Maintain relationships between entities such as owners, inventors, and agents.
3. **Querying and Retrieval**: Enable easy querying and retrieval of IP assets.
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensure data integrity and consistency within the database.

## Data Model (5 Collections) with Explanation

### Collection 1: Patents

This collection stores information about patents, including their title, abstract, publication date, filing date, inventors, assignees, and related documents.
